Synth Quiz
==============

dedicated to all synthesizers and electronic music lovers!

Synth Quiz is a game for Android modeled after the various logo/movies/cars/whatever quiz
that are so abundant in the Play Store. if you ever played one of
those, you should be familiar. if you didn't, the super-short
explanation is: try to guess the maker and the model of the synth
you see in the picture.

this is an Eclipse project, you will need to have the Android Development

will require additional software (perl, ImageMagick, pngnq, SQLite).
